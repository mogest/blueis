# blueis

A redis-compatible disk-based database.

On memory-constrained systems, you might want a store with the simplicity of redis, but without keeping the whole
store loaded in memory.  blueis stores data in a sqlite3 database.  This makes it much, much slower than redis.

blueis is wildly incomplete, still in development.

## Building it

You'll need Rust installed.

    cargo build

## Running it

If you want it to accept connections from other computers on the typical redis port:

    blueis 0.0.0.0:6379 /path/to/database.sqlite3

If the database doesn't exist, it'll create it.
